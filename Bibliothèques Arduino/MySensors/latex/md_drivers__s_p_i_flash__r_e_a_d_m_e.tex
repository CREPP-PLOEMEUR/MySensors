Arduino/\+Moteino library for read/write access to S\+PI flash memory chips. This works with 256byte/page S\+PI flash memory such as the \href{https://lowpowerlab.com/shop/product/72}{\texttt{ 4M\+B\+IT W25\+X40\+C\+L\+S\+N\+IG}} used on \href{https://www.moteino.com}{\texttt{ Moteino}} for data storage and wireless programming. ~\newline
 For instance a 4M\+Bit (512Kbyte) flash chip will have 2048 pages\+: 256$\ast$2048 = 524288 bytes (512Kbytes). ~\newline
Minimal modifications should allow chips that have different page size to work. ~\newline
D\+E\+P\+E\+N\+DS ON\+: Arduino native {\itshape S\+PI library}. ~\newline
 This library was primarily developed to enable {\bfseries{safe}} wireless programming on Moteino nodes and Moteino based applications such as the \href{https://lowpowerlab.com/guide/switchmote/}{\texttt{ Switch\+Mote}}. This has been documented at \href{https://lowpowerlab.com/guide/moteino/wireless-programming/}{\texttt{ lowpowerlab}}. \href{https://github.com/LowPowerLab/DualOptiboot}{\texttt{ Dualoptiboot}} (all A\+VR based Moteinos come with it) and \href{https://github.com/LowPowerLab/RFM69}{\texttt{ R\+F\+M69\+\_\+\+O\+TA Wireless\+Programming library}} are required to be able to wirelessly re-\/flash a remote Moteino.\hypertarget{md_drivers__s_p_i_flash__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md70}{}\doxysubsection{Installation}\label{md_drivers__s_p_i_flash__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md70}
