This library allows the usage of internal Flash memory. To enhance the limited erase cycles a Virtual\+Page layer is available. On top of Virtual\+Page, there is an N\+V\+R\+AM class to allow a lot of writes by using a log-\/based storage.

For Arduino compatibility, a subset of avr/eeprom.\+h functionality and a complete port of E\+E\+P\+R\+O\+M.\+h is provided.

Accessing bytes via N\+V\+R\+AM or E\+E\+P\+R\+OM is faster than an A\+VR controller until the internal log is full. At this point, a new page must build. This process takes up to 3400ms (n\+R\+F51) or 1300ms (n\+R\+F52) depending on your hardware and the highest written address.

To find out more about timing, please run \char`\"{}test\+\_\+all\char`\"{} example.

{\itshape This code is not compatible with any Soft\+Device.

This class is the hardware abstraction to the Flash controller. Please look into \mbox{\hyperlink{_flash_8h}{Flash.\+h}} for a more detailed description.

Please read the documentation of your microcontroller to find out limitations about writing into flash. You can use the F\+L\+A\+S\+H\+\_\+... defines in your code to take care about quirks.\hypertarget{md_drivers__n_v_m__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md62}{}\doxysubsection{Virtual\+Page.\+h}\label{md_drivers__n_v_m__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md62}
This class provides manages Flash pages. This helps you to reach more erase cycles and handle page faults. The underlying Flash page needs to hold some metadata so a Virtual\+Page is some bytes smaller than 4k. The size can differ between different hardware.

If you need to allocate Virtual\+Pages in performance critical situations, call Virtual\+Page.\+clean\+\_\+up(), when you have a time slot of more than 100ms.

For Virtual\+Pages the last 16k(n\+R\+F51) or 32k(n\+R\+F52) are used. This allows the same number of erase cycles on both platforms.\hypertarget{md_drivers__n_v_m__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md63}{}\doxysubsection{N\+V\+R\+A\+M.\+h}\label{md_drivers__n_v_m__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md63}
This class provides a 3072 bytes large memory. You can access this memory in a random order without needing to take care of the underlying flash architecture. This class is stateless, this means there is nothing cached in R\+AM. With every access, the data structure is parsed. This saves R\+AM and avoids conflicts when you have more than one instance of N\+V\+R\+AM class in your code.

To reach a maximum of write cycles and performance, place all your data at the beginning of the memory. This allows a maximum of write cycles.

When you only use the first 8 Bytes of the N\+V\+R\+AM, you have 5,100,000 write cycles per byte. If you use all 3072 bytes, you have only 3,300 write cycles per byte.

For your own calculation of write cycles, you can calculate the sum of available writes with\+: (Virtual\+Page.\+length()-\/4-\/H\+I\+G\+H\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+A\+D\+D\+R\+E\+S\+S/4)$\ast$40,000

Reading or writing the N\+V\+R\+AM is fast until the internal log is full. On n\+R\+F51 you can calculate with 1.\+2ms and on n\+R\+F52 with 0,5ms. If the log is full a new Virtual\+Page is allocated and written. This procedure can take a time of 3400ms (n\+R\+F51) or 1300ms (n\+R\+F52).

If you use this code in performance critical situations. Use N\+V\+R\+A\+M.\+write\+\_\+prepare(\+N\+U\+M\+B\+E\+R) before to guarantee a fast write for the given number of bytes.\hypertarget{md_drivers__n_v_m__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md64}{}\doxysubsection{E\+E\+P\+R\+O\+M.\+h and avr\+\_\+eeprom.\+h}\label{md_drivers__n_v_m__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md64}
Both libraries are for Arduino compatibility. Instead of avr/eeprom.\+h, you have to include avr\+\_\+eeprom.\+h. This file maps a limited set of functions to N\+V\+R\+AM.

The E\+E\+P\+R\+O\+M.\+h is fully compatible with the A\+VR version without committing changes.

If you use one of both files, please keep in mind that writing a single byte is fast until the log becomes full. In that case, a single write operation can take up to 3400ms (n\+R\+F51) or 1300ms (n\+R\+F52).
