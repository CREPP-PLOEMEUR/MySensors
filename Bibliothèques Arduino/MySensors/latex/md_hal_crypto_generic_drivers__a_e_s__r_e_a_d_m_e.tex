This is an \mbox{\hyperlink{class_a_e_s}{A\+ES}} implementation that uses only 8-\/bit byte operations on the cipher state (there are options to use 32-\/bit types if available).

The combination of mix columns and byte substitution used here is based on that developed by Karl Malbrain. His contribution is acknowledged. $\ast$/

/$\ast$ This version derived by Mark Tillotson 2012-\/01-\/23, tidied up, slimmed down and tailored to 8-\/bit microcontroller abilities and Arduino datatypes.

The s-\/box and inverse s-\/box were retained as tables (0.\+5kB P\+R\+O\+G\+M\+EM) but all the other transformations are coded to save table space. Many efficiency improvments to the routines mix\+\_\+sub\+\_\+columns() and inv\+\_\+mix\+\_\+sub\+\_\+columns() (mainly common sub-\/expression elimination).

Only the routines with precalculated subkey schedule are retained (together with set\+\_\+key() -\/ this does however mean each \mbox{\hyperlink{class_a_e_s}{A\+ES}} object takes 240 bytes of R\+AM, alas)

The C\+BC routines side-\/effect the iv argument (so that successive calls work together correctly).

All the encryption and decryption routines work with plain == cipher for in-\/place encryption, note.
