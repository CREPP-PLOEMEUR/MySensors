This is a C library for Raspberry Pi (R\+Pi). It provides access to G\+P\+IO and other IO functions on the Broadcom B\+CM 2835 chip, as used in the Raspberry\+Pi, allowing access to the G\+P\+IO pins on the 26 pin I\+DE plug on the R\+Pi board so you can control and interface with various external devices.  


This is a C library for Raspberry Pi (R\+Pi). It provides access to G\+P\+IO and other IO functions on the Broadcom B\+CM 2835 chip, as used in the Raspberry\+Pi, allowing access to the G\+P\+IO pins on the 26 pin I\+DE plug on the R\+Pi board so you can control and interface with various external devices. 

It provides functions for reading digital inputs and setting digital outputs, using S\+PI and I2C, and for accessing the system timers. Pin event detection is supported by polling (interrupts are not supported).

Works on all versions upt to and including R\+PI 4. Works with all versions of Debian up to and including Debian Buster 10.

It is C++ compatible, and installs as a header file and non-\/shared library on any Linux-\/based distro (but clearly is no use except on Raspberry Pi or another board with B\+CM 2835).

Tested on debian6-\/19-\/04-\/2012, 2012-\/07-\/15-\/wheezy-\/raspbian, 2013-\/07-\/26-\/wheezy-\/raspbian and Occidentalisv01, 2016-\/02-\/09 Raspbian Jessie. C\+A\+U\+T\+I\+ON\+: it has been observed that when detect enables such as \mbox{\hyperlink{group__gpio_ga8e990d48db929445ac3e899ca0f5ed07}{bcm2835\+\_\+gpio\+\_\+len()}} are used and the pin is pulled L\+OW it can cause temporary hangs on 2012-\/07-\/15-\/wheezy-\/raspbian, 2013-\/07-\/26-\/wheezy-\/raspbian and Occidentalisv01. Reason for this is not yet determined, but we suspect that an interrupt handler is hitting a hard loop on those O\+Ss. If you must use \mbox{\hyperlink{group__gpio_ga8e990d48db929445ac3e899ca0f5ed07}{bcm2835\+\_\+gpio\+\_\+len()}} and friends, make sure you disable the pins with \mbox{\hyperlink{group__gpio_gac3b51f656f5495dad715ff3c01417aea}{bcm2835\+\_\+gpio\+\_\+clr\+\_\+len()}} and friends after use.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Running as root}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
Prior to the release of Raspbian Jessie in Feb 2016, access to any peripheral device via /dev/mem on the R\+Pi required the process to run as root. Raspbian Jessie permits non-\/root users to access the G\+P\+IO peripheral (only) via /dev/gpiomem, and this library supports that limited mode of operation.

If the library runs with effective U\+ID of 0 (ie root), then \mbox{\hyperlink{group__init_ga9351fa3ec8eeff4e9d998d3d5d912a4f}{bcm2835\+\_\+init()}} will attempt to open /dev/mem, and, if successful, it will permit use of all peripherals and library functions.

If the library runs with any other effective U\+ID (ie not root), then \mbox{\hyperlink{group__init_ga9351fa3ec8eeff4e9d998d3d5d912a4f}{bcm2835\+\_\+init()}} will attempt to open /dev/gpiomem, and, if successful, will only permit G\+P\+IO operations. In particular, \mbox{\hyperlink{group__spi_ga6f0330a183f3c5765a36f1839e029a44}{bcm2835\+\_\+spi\+\_\+begin()}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{group__i2c_gaae82c3f4b7dfb4dcb51358d1ae878029}{bcm2835\+\_\+i2c\+\_\+begin()}} will return false and all other non-\/gpio operations may fail silently or crash.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Installation}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
This library consists of a single non-\/shared library and header file, which will be installed in the usual places by make install


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\# download the latest version of the library, say bcm2835-\/1.xx.tar.gz, then:}}
\DoxyCodeLine{tar zxvf bcm2835-\/1.xx.tar.gz}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd bcm2835-\/1.xx}
\DoxyCodeLine{./configure}
\DoxyCodeLine{make}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo make check}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo make install}
\end{DoxyCode}


\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Physical Addresses}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
The functions \mbox{\hyperlink{group__lowlevel_ga5f242135f5088f8c319492426a1ed5e3}{bcm2835\+\_\+peri\+\_\+read()}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{group__lowlevel_ga639da6963ab76e3109b9909f3a9e6171}{bcm2835\+\_\+peri\+\_\+write()}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{group__lowlevel_ga01949a6285305f38ce0a47154e55c1b6}{bcm2835\+\_\+peri\+\_\+set\+\_\+bits()}} are low level peripheral register access functions. They are designed to use physical addresses as described in section 1.\+2.\+3 A\+RM physical addresses of the B\+C\+M2835 A\+RM Peripherals manual. Physical addresses range from 0x20000000 to 0x20\+F\+F\+F\+F\+FF for peripherals. The bus addresses for peripherals are set up to map onto the peripheral bus address range starting at 0x7\+E000000. Thus a peripheral advertised in the manual at bus address 0x7\+Ennnnnn is available at physical address 0x20nnnnnn.

On R\+PI 2, the peripheral addresses are different and the bcm2835 library gets them from reading /proc/device-\/tree/soc/ranges. This is only availble with recent versions of the kernel on R\+PI 2.

After initialisation, the base address of the various peripheral registers are available with the following externals\+: bcm2835\+\_\+gpio bcm2835\+\_\+pwm bcm2835\+\_\+clk bcm2835\+\_\+pads bcm2835\+\_\+spio0 bcm2835\+\_\+st bcm2835\+\_\+bsc0 bcm2835\+\_\+bsc1 bcm2835\+\_\+aux bcm2835\+\_\+spi1

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Raspberry Pi 2 (R\+P\+I2)}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
For this library to work correctly on R\+P\+I2, you M\+U\+ST have the device tree support enabled in the kernel. You should also ensure you are using the latest version of Linux. The library has been tested on R\+P\+I2 with 2015-\/02-\/16-\/raspbian-\/wheezy and Arch\+Linux\+A\+R\+M-\/rpi-\/2 as of 2015-\/03-\/29.

When device tree suport is enabled, the file /proc/device-\/tree/soc/ranges will appear in the file system, and the bcm2835 module relies on its presence to correctly run on R\+P\+I2 (it is optional for R\+P\+I1). Without device tree support enabled and the presence of this file, it will not work on R\+P\+I2.

To enable device tree support\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo raspi-\/\mbox{\hyperlink{structconfig}{config}}}
\DoxyCodeLine{ under Advanced Options -\/ enable Device Tree}
\DoxyCodeLine{ Reboot.}
\end{DoxyCode}


\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Pin Numbering}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
The G\+P\+IO pin numbering as used by R\+Pi is different to and inconsistent with the underlying B\+CM 2835 chip pin numbering. \href{http://elinux.org/RPi_BCM2835_GPIOs}{\texttt{ http\+://elinux.\+org/\+R\+Pi\+\_\+\+B\+C\+M2835\+\_\+\+G\+P\+I\+Os}}

R\+Pi has a 26 pin I\+DE header that provides access to some of the G\+P\+IO pins on the B\+CM 2835, as well as power and ground pins. Not all G\+P\+IO pins on the B\+CM 2835 are available on the I\+DE header.

R\+Pi Version 2 also has a P5 connector with 4 G\+P\+IO pins, 5V, 3.\+3V and Gnd.

The functions in this library are designed to be passed the B\+CM 2835 G\+P\+IO pin number and {\itshape not} the R\+Pi pin number. There are symbolic definitions for each of the available pins that you should use for convenience. See \mbox{\hyperlink{group__constants_ga63c029bd6500167152db4e57736d0939}{R\+Pi\+G\+P\+I\+O\+Pin}}.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{S\+PI Pins}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
The bcm2835\+\_\+spi\+\_\+$\ast$ functions allow you to control the B\+CM 2835 S\+P\+I0 interface, allowing you to send and received data by S\+PI (Serial Peripheral Interface). For more information about S\+PI, see \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus}{\texttt{ http\+://en.\+wikipedia.\+org/wiki/\+Serial\+\_\+\+Peripheral\+\_\+\+Interface\+\_\+\+Bus}}

When \mbox{\hyperlink{group__spi_ga6f0330a183f3c5765a36f1839e029a44}{bcm2835\+\_\+spi\+\_\+begin()}} is called it changes the bahaviour of the S\+PI interface pins from their default G\+P\+IO behaviour in order to support S\+PI. While S\+PI is in use, you will not be able to control the state of the S\+PI pins through the usual bcm2835\+\_\+spi\+\_\+gpio\+\_\+write(). When \mbox{\hyperlink{group__spi_gad25421b3a4a6ca280dfdd39c94c3279a}{bcm2835\+\_\+spi\+\_\+end()}} is called, the S\+PI pins will all revert to inputs, and can then be configured and controled with the usual bcm2835\+\_\+gpio\+\_\+$\ast$ calls.

The Raspberry Pi G\+P\+IO pins used for S\+PI are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item P1-\/19 (M\+O\+SI)
\item P1-\/21 (M\+I\+SO)
\item P1-\/23 (C\+LK)
\item P1-\/24 (C\+E0)
\item P1-\/26 (C\+E1)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Although it is possible to select high speeds for the S\+PI interface, up to 125M\+Hz (see \mbox{\hyperlink{group__spi_gad623657d9513faa89d22ae1dc87eec38}{bcm2835\+\_\+spi\+\_\+set\+Clock\+Divider()}}) you should not expect to actually achieve those sorts of speeds with the R\+Pi wiring. Our tests on R\+Pi 2 show that the S\+PI C\+LK line when unloaded has a resonant frequency of about 40M\+Hz, and when loaded, the M\+O\+SI and M\+I\+SO lines ring at an even lower frequency. Measurements show that S\+PI waveforms are very poor and unusable at 62 and 125M\+Hz. Dont expect any speed faster than 31M\+Hz to work reliably.

The bcm2835\+\_\+aux\+\_\+spi\+\_\+$\ast$ functions allow you to control the B\+CM 2835 S\+P\+I1 interface, allowing you to send and received data by S\+PI (Serial Peripheral Interface).

The Raspberry Pi G\+P\+IO pins used for A\+UX S\+PI (S\+P\+I1) are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item P1-\/38 (M\+O\+SI)
\item P1-\/35 (M\+I\+SO)
\item P1-\/40 (C\+LK)
\item P1-\/36 (C\+E2)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{I2C Pins}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
The bcm2835\+\_\+i2c\+\_\+$\ast$ functions allow you to control the B\+CM 2835 B\+SC interface, allowing you to send and received data by I2C (\char`\"{}eye-\/squared cee\char`\"{}; generically referred to as \char`\"{}two-\/wire interface\char`\"{}) . For more information about I?C, see \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I\%C2\%B2C}{\texttt{ http\+://en.\+wikipedia.\+org/wiki/\+I\%\+C2\%\+B2C}}

The Raspberry Pi V2 G\+P\+IO pins used for I2C are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item P1-\/03 (S\+DA)
\item P1-\/05 (S\+LC)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{P\+WM}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
The B\+C\+M2835 supports hardware P\+WM on a limited subset of G\+P\+IO pins. This bcm2835 library provides functions for configuring and controlling P\+WM output on these pins.

The B\+C\+M2835 contains 2 independent P\+WM channels (0 and 1), each of which be connnected to a limited subset of G\+P\+IO pins. The following G\+P\+IO pins may be connected to the following P\+WM channels (from section 9.\+5)\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{GPIO PIN    RPi pin  PWM Channel    ALT FUN}
\DoxyCodeLine{12                    0            0}
\DoxyCodeLine{13                    1            0}
\DoxyCodeLine{18         1-\/12       0            5}
\DoxyCodeLine{19                    1            5}
\DoxyCodeLine{40                    0            0}
\DoxyCodeLine{41                    1            0}
\DoxyCodeLine{45                    1            0}
\DoxyCodeLine{52                    0            1}
\DoxyCodeLine{53                    1            1}
\end{DoxyCode}
 In order for a G\+P\+IO pin to emit output from its P\+WM channel, it must be set to the Alt Function given above. Note carefully that current versions of the Raspberry Pi only expose one of these pins (G\+P\+IO 18 = R\+Pi Pin 1-\/12) on the IO headers, and therefore this is the only IO pin on the R\+Pi that can be used for P\+WM. Further it must be set to A\+LT F\+UN 5 to get P\+WM output.

Both P\+WM channels are driven by the same P\+WM clock, whose clock dvider can be varied using \mbox{\hyperlink{group__pwm_ga4487f4e26e57ea3697a57cf52b8de35b}{bcm2835\+\_\+pwm\+\_\+set\+\_\+clock()}}. Each channel can be separately enabled with \mbox{\hyperlink{group__pwm_ga7e2eddac472b6d81e0ba7dbf165672cb}{bcm2835\+\_\+pwm\+\_\+set\+\_\+mode()}}. The average output of the P\+WM channel is determined by the ratio of D\+A\+T\+A/\+R\+A\+N\+GE for that channel. Use \mbox{\hyperlink{group__pwm_ga9f5ca04d4f859d96f1205a03c79de7ce}{bcm2835\+\_\+pwm\+\_\+set\+\_\+range()}} to set the range and \mbox{\hyperlink{group__pwm_ga4f445a60ace471a01d0cc4015bcea1dd}{bcm2835\+\_\+pwm\+\_\+set\+\_\+data()}} to set the data in that ratio

Each P\+WM channel can run in either Balanced or Mark-\/\+Space mode. In Balanced mode, the hardware sends a combination of clock pulses that results in an overall D\+A\+TA pulses per R\+A\+N\+GE pulses. In Mark-\/\+Space mode, the hardware sets the output H\+I\+GH for D\+A\+TA clock pulses wide, followed by L\+OW for R\+A\+N\+G\+E-\/\+D\+A\+TA clock pulses.

The P\+WM clock can be set to control the P\+WM pulse widths. The P\+WM clock is derived from a 19.\+2\+M\+Hz clock. You can set any divider, but some common ones are provided by the B\+C\+M2835\+\_\+\+P\+W\+M\+\_\+\+C\+L\+O\+C\+K\+\_\+\+D\+I\+V\+I\+D\+E\+R\+\_\+$\ast$ values of bcm2835\+P\+W\+M\+Clock\+Divider.

For example, say you wanted to drive a DC motor with P\+WM at about 1k\+Hz, and control the speed in 1/1024 increments from 0/1024 (stopped) through to 1024/1024 (full on). In that case you might set the clock divider to be 16, and the R\+A\+N\+GE to 1024. The pulse repetition frequency will be 1.\+2\+M\+Hz/1024 = 1171.\+875\+Hz.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Interactions with other systems}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
In order for bcm2835 library S\+PI to work, you may need to disable the S\+PI kernel module using\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo raspi-\/\mbox{\hyperlink{structconfig}{config}}}
\DoxyCodeLine{ under Advanced Options -\/ enable Device Tree}
\DoxyCodeLine{ under Advanced Options -\/ disable SPI}
\DoxyCodeLine{ Reboot.}
\end{DoxyCode}


Since bcm2835 accesses the lowest level hardware interfaces (in eh intererests of speed and flexibility) there can be intercations with other low level software trying to do similar things.

It seems that with \char`\"{}latest\char`\"{} 8.\+0 Jessie 4.\+9.\+24-\/v7+ kernel P\+WM just won\textquotesingle{}t work unless you disable audio. There\textquotesingle{}s a line 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{dtparam=audio=on}
\end{DoxyCode}
 in the /boot/config.txt. Comment it out like this\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#dtparam=audio=on}}
\end{DoxyCode}


\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Real Time performance constraints}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
The bcm2835 is a library for user programs (i.\+e. they run in \textquotesingle{}userland\textquotesingle{}). Such programs are not part of the kernel and are usually subject to paging and swapping by the kernel while it does other things besides running your program. This means that you should not expect to get real-\/time performance or real-\/time timing constraints from such programs. In particular, there is no guarantee that the \mbox{\hyperlink{group__gpio_ga3ffbe079732a995cfacd691f677d9789}{bcm2835\+\_\+delay()}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{group__gpio_gade50bd6947463a242783accf91e5b5e4}{bcm2835\+\_\+delay\+Microseconds()}} will return after exactly the time requested. In fact, depending on other activity on the host, IO etc, you might get significantly longer delay times than the one you asked for. So please dont expect to get exactly the time delay you request.

Arjan reports that you can prevent swapping on Linux with the following code fragment\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}

Other pins that were already previously enabled stay enabled. Added \mbox{\hyperlink{group__gpio_gaa5826edb1b17dd9095fa3bcae5ded485}{bcm2835\+\_\+gpio\+\_\+clr\+\_\+ren()}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{group__gpio_ga196b61d8bf334be6acec590de6dc8f88}{bcm2835\+\_\+gpio\+\_\+clr\+\_\+fen()}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{group__gpio_ga3c3b5297f5c2aeb5d2046a5b6de15d96}{bcm2835\+\_\+gpio\+\_\+clr\+\_\+hen()}} \mbox{\hyperlink{group__gpio_gac3b51f656f5495dad715ff3c01417aea}{bcm2835\+\_\+gpio\+\_\+clr\+\_\+len()}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{group__gpio_ga6f3e122871853b34d97b65284cf7cc47}{bcm2835\+\_\+gpio\+\_\+clr\+\_\+aren()}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{group__gpio_ga8ec8bf224e25ed395d4eecf3ad308ca3}{bcm2835\+\_\+gpio\+\_\+clr\+\_\+afen()}} to clear the enable for individual pins, suggested by Andreas Sundstrom.

1.\+7 Added bcm2835\+\_\+spi\+\_\+transfernb to support different buffers for read and write.

1.\+8 Improvements to read barrier, as suggested by maddin.

1.\+9 Improvements contributed by mikew\+: I noticed that it was mallocing memory for the mmaps on /dev/mem. It\textquotesingle{}s not necessary to do that, you can just mmap the file directly, so I\textquotesingle{}ve removed the mallocs (and frees). I\textquotesingle{}ve also modified delay\+Microseconds() to use nanosleep() for long waits, and a busy wait on a high resolution timer for the rest. This is because I\textquotesingle{}ve found that calling nanosleep() takes at least 100-\/200 us. You need to link using \textquotesingle{}-\/lrt\textquotesingle{} using this version. I\textquotesingle{}ve added some unsigned casts to the debug prints to silence compiler warnings I was getting, fixed some typos, and changed the value of B\+C\+M2835\+\_\+\+P\+A\+D\+\_\+\+H\+Y\+S\+T\+E\+R\+E\+S\+I\+S\+\_\+\+E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+ED to 0x08 as per Gert van Loo\textquotesingle{}s doc at \href{http://www.scribd.com/doc/101830961/GPIO-Pads-Control2}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+scribd.\+com/doc/101830961/\+G\+P\+I\+O-\/\+Pads-\/\+Control2}} Also added a define for the passwrd value that Gert says is needed to change pad control settings.

1.\+10 Changed the names of the delay functions to \mbox{\hyperlink{group__gpio_ga3ffbe079732a995cfacd691f677d9789}{bcm2835\+\_\+delay()}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{group__gpio_gade50bd6947463a242783accf91e5b5e4}{bcm2835\+\_\+delay\+Microseconds()}} to prevent collisions with wiring\+Pi. Macros to map delay()-\/$>$ \mbox{\hyperlink{group__gpio_ga3ffbe079732a995cfacd691f677d9789}{bcm2835\+\_\+delay()}} and Macros to map delay\+Microseconds()-\/$>$ \mbox{\hyperlink{group__gpio_gade50bd6947463a242783accf91e5b5e4}{bcm2835\+\_\+delay\+Microseconds()}}, which can be disabled by defining B\+C\+M2835\+\_\+\+N\+O\+\_\+\+D\+E\+L\+A\+Y\+\_\+\+C\+O\+M\+P\+A\+T\+I\+B\+I\+L\+I\+TY

1.\+11 Fixed incorrect link to download file

1.\+14 Now compiles even if C\+L\+O\+C\+K\+\_\+\+M\+O\+N\+O\+T\+O\+N\+I\+C\+\_\+\+R\+AW is not available, uses C\+L\+O\+C\+K\+\_\+\+M\+O\+N\+O\+T\+O\+N\+IC instead. Fixed errors in documentation of S\+PI divider frequencies based on 250M\+Hz clock. Reported by Ben Simpson.

1.\+15 Added \mbox{\hyperlink{group__init_ga3a42892f61764132d106a4ae32271002}{bcm2835\+\_\+close()}} to end of examples as suggested by Mark Wolfe.
